# Star-Data-Calculation
Calculating the necessary values needed for an accurate Lyman alpha reconstruction

# Data Needed
Only a fits file is needed to perform the calculations

# Data Calculated
- radial velocity
- logarithm of the amplitude of the Lorentzian (emission line)
- FWHM of the Lorentzian
- logarithm of the ISM H I column density
- Doppler broadening parameter
- radial velocity of the ISM absorbers
